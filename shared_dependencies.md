1. Dependencies: These would be shared across all files. They would include libraries such as fs (file system) for file handling, and jest for testing.

2. Exported Variables: 
   - "src/refactorTool.js" would export the main function for refactoring, likely named "refactor".
   - "src/fileHandler.js" would export functions for reading and writing files, likely named "readFile" and "writeFile".
   - "src/lineCounter.js" would export a function for counting lines in a file, likely named "countLines".
   - "src/fileSplitter.js" would export a function for splitting a file, likely named "splitFile".
   - "src/utils.js" would export any utility functions used across the other files.

3. Data Schemas: There may be a shared schema for representing a file, including its name, path, and content.

4. ID Names of DOM Elements: As this is a backend tool, there would likely be no DOM elements involved.

5. Message Names: There may be standardised names for error or success messages, such as "fileNotFound", "fileSplitSuccess".

6. Function Names: As mentioned above, function names like "refactor", "readFile", "writeFile", "countLines", "splitFile" would be shared across multiple files.

7. Configuration Files: "package.json" and "tsconfig.json" would be shared across all files for project configuration and TypeScript configuration respectively.

8. ".gitignore" would be used to ignore node_modules and other non-essential files in the git repository.
