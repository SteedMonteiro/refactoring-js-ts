Shared Dependencies:

1. **Libraries and Tools**: Node.js, jscodeshift, ESLint. These are used across multiple files for various tasks such as AST manipulation, code quality checks, and scripting.

2. **Project Specifications**: These are the criteria for refactoring, such as maximum lines of code per file or function, maximum characters per line, etc. These specifications are used in the source code analysis, refactoring strategy, and code quality checks.

3. **Codebase**: The codebase is the target of the refactoring process. It is analyzed in the source code analysis, modified in the refactoring implementation, and tested in the unit and integration tests.

4. **Refactoring Logic**: This is the logic that determines how the code should be refactored. It is defined in the refactoring strategy, implemented in the refactoring implementation, and tested in the unit tests.

5. **Test Cases**: These are used in the unit tests to verify the refactoring logic, and in the integration tests to verify the functionality of the refactored codebase.

6. **Documentation**: The documentation is updated in the documentation file to reflect the changes made during the refactoring process. It is also used in the code review to understand the changes made.

7. **Maintenance Logic**: This is the logic that allows for updates to the refactoring logic and guidelines. It is defined and implemented in the maintenance file.

Function Names:

1. **analyzeCodebase**: This function is used in the source code analysis to scan the codebase and identify files and functions that need refactoring.

2. **detectLargeComponents**: This function is used in the detection of large functions and components to identify components that are too large.

3. **refactorCode**: This function is used in the refactoring implementation to modify the AST and generate the new code.

4. **runUnitTests**: This function is used in the unit tests to verify the refactoring logic.

5. **runIntegrationTests**: This function is used in the integration tests to verify the functionality of the refactored codebase.

6. **reviewCode**: This function is used in the code review to manually review the changes made during the refactoring process.

7. **updateDocumentation**: This function is used in the documentation file to document the changes made, the reasons for the refactoring, and how to use the refactoring script for future needs.

8. **maintainScript**: This function is used in the maintenance file to keep the script updated according to new coding practices and changes in the codebase.
