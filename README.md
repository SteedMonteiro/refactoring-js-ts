# TypeScript Refactoring Tool

This command line tool automates the refactoring process for a TypeScript codebase, ensuring that individual files and functions adhere to specified guidelines for readability and maintainability.

## Features

1. **Source Code Analysis**: Scans the codebase to identify files and functions that need refactoring.
2. **Automated Refactoring**: Uses AST to safely refactor code.
3. **Code Quality Checks**: Integrates with ESLint to ensure that the refactored code meets quality standards.
4. **Testing Support**: Provides a way to write unit tests to verify the refactoring logic.
5. **Documentation**: Generates documentation detailing the changes made.
6. **Maintenance Mode**: Allows for easy updates to the refactoring logic and guidelines.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Configure the tool with the project-specific criteria and rules.
2. **Execution**: Run the tool to analyze the current state of the codebase, and execute the refactoring process.
3. **Review**: Manually review the changes, verify through tests, and merge into the main branch if everything is as expected.
4. **Documentation**: Document the changes and update any relevant project documentation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Configure the tool with your project-specific criteria and rules by modifying the `src/initialize.ts` file.
4. Run the tool with `node src/execute.ts`.
5. Review the changes, verify through tests, and if everything is as expected, merge into the main branch.
6. Document the changes and update any relevant project documentation using `src/documentation.ts`.
7. Keep the script updated according to new coding practices and changes in the codebase using `src/maintenance.ts`.
