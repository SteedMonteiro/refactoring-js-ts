Certainly! This tool aims to automate the refactoring process for a JavaScript or TypeScript codebase by ensuring that individual files and functions adhere to specified guidelines for readability and maintainability. It would accomplish this by using various technologies such as jscodeshift for AST manipulation, ESLint for code quality checks, and Node.js for scripting.

### Features:

1. **Source Code Analysis**: Scans the codebase to identify files and functions that need refactoring based on the defined criteria, such as maximum lines of code per file or per function.

2. **Automated Refactoring**: Uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to safely refactor code by breaking down large components into smaller ones or by externalizing large functions.

3. **Code Quality Checks**: Optionally integrates with ESLint to ensure that the refactored code meets quality standards like maximum characters per line.

4. **Testing Support**: Provides a way to write unit tests to verify the refactoring logic.

5. **Documentation**: Generates documentation detailing the changes made, the reason for each change, and guidelines for future refactoring.

6. **Maintenance Mode**: Allows for easy updates to the refactoring logic and guidelines to adapt to evolving code styles and practices.

### Workflow:

1. **Initialization**: Configure the tool with the project-specific criteria and rules.

2. **Execution**: Run the tool to analyze the current state of the codebase, and execute the refactoring process automatically.

3. **Review**: Manually review the changes, verify through tests, and merge into the main branch if everything is as expected.

4. **Documentation**: Document the changes and update any relevant project documentation.

This tool is intended for development teams that want to maintain a clean, well-structured codebase. It helps to automate what is often a labor-intensive and error-prone process, making it easier to manage larger and more complex projects.  Certainly! Here's a detailed project outline translated into English:

### Phase 1: Planning and Research

1. **Evaluate Technologies**  : Study available libraries and tools for AST (Abstract Syntax Trees) manipulation in JavaScript/TypeScript. Good candidates include jscodeshift, ESLint, and Babel.

2. **Project Specifications**  : Establish precise criteria for the refactoring, such as the maximum number of lines per file, the maximum number of characters per line, etc.

3. **Code Sampling**  : Examine some representative files from the codebase popular codebase in react in typescript. This will help you understand common coding patterns and refactoring opportunities.

### Phase 2: Environment Setup

1. Install necessary tools like Node.js, jscodeshift, ESLint, etc.

2. **Configure ESLint Rules (optional)**  : If you are using ESLint to check for code readability (for example, maximum characters per line), configure the ESLint rules accordingly.

3. **Create a Working Directory**  : Create a directory for your refactoring script and add any necessary configurations there.

### Phase 3: Development

1. **Source Code Analysis** :  Write a script to traverse the codebase and identify files that require refactoring based on established criteria.

2. **Detection of Large Functions and Components** : Use AST to detect functions and components that are too large.

3. **Refactoring Strategy** :Write the logic to decide whether a large component/function should be split into smaller components or functions, or whether functions should be externalized.

4. **Refactoring Implementation** :Implement the refactoring logic by modifying the AST and generating the new code.

5. **Unit Tests**:  Write tests to verify that the refactoring script works as expected.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. **Run Script on a Test Branch** : Run the script on a copy of the codebase and review the changes.

2. **Code Review** : Perform a manual code review to ensure the refactoring is logical and doesn't introduce bugs.

3. **Integration Tests** : Run integration tests to make sure the refactored codebase functions as expected.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance

1. **Merge into Main Branch** : Once everything has been tested and verified, merge the changes into the main branch.

2. **Documentation** : Document the changes, the reasons for the refactoring, and how to use the refactoring script for future needs.

3. **Maintenance** : Keep the script updated according to new coding practices and changes in the codebase.

Each step requires careful planning and execution. The development phase is particularly tricky and should be done by someone with a strong understanding of ASTs and the target programming language (JavaScript/TypeScript in this case).
